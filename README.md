⭐ Hello, I'm Jessica!

I'm an undergraduate at Columbia University working through industry and academic positions. I'm interested in backend development, scientific computing, and artificial intelligence. From developing frontend modules within General Atomics' fusion energy framework, OMFIT, to developing backend solutions within startups like Oro Labs and established companies like Chemstations, I really enjoy exploring all kinds of fields and industries! At the moment I work primarily in Python and Java, with a background in C/C++.
